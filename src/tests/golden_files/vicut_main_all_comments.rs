// We need to initialize stream in each branch, since Box<dyn BufReader> does not implement send/sync
// Each route in this function operates on individual lines from the input

// Pair each line with its original index
// Reads the complete input from stdin and then splits it into its lines for execution.
// This function is used for `--linewise` execution on stdin.
// Executes commands on lines from stdin, using multi-threaded processing
// Sort lines
// Write back to file
// Separate content by file
// Process each line's content
// Backup files are created if `--backup-files` is enabled.
// Errors during reading, transformation, or writing will abort the program with a diagnostic.
//     - Print to `stdout`, optionally prefixed by filename (`if multiple input files`)
//     - Write the result back to the original file (`-i is set`)
// 7. Reconstruct each file's contents and either:
// 6. Sort each file‚Äôs lines by line number to restore the original order.
// 5. Group the transformed lines by filename in a `BTreeMap`.
// 4. Use a parallel iterator to transform each line using `execute()`.
// 3. Tag each line with its originating filename and line number.
// 2. Combine all lines from all files into a single work pool.

// This function is used for `--linewise` execution. It processes all lines in parallel,
// Executes all input files line-by-line using multi-threaded processing.
// Write back to file
// Process each file's content
// 3. Decide how to handle output depending on whether args.edit_inplace is set.
// 2. Call `execute()` on each file's contents
// 1. Create a `work` vector containing a tuple of the file's path, and it's contents.
// The steps this function walks through are as follows:
// Multi-thread the execution of file input.
// -n
// -c name=<NAME> <VIM_CMDS>
// -c <VIM_CMDS>
// -m <VIM_CMDS>
// Negative branch
// Execute our commands
// Set the cursor on the start of the line
// Positive branch
// LineBuf::eval_motion() *always* returns MotionKind::Lines() for Motion::Global/NotGlobal.
// Here we ask ViCut's editor directly to evaluate the Global motion for us.
// -g/-v <PATTERN> <COMMANDS> [--else <COMMANDS>]
// We use recursion so that we can nest repeats easily
// -r <N> <R>
// Execute a single `Cmd`
// in each line. The newline characters are vital to `LineBuf`'s navigation logic.
// We use this instead of `String::lines()` because that method does not include the newline itself
// Split a string slice into it's lines.

// want to see that output, with or without globals.
// But if the files vector is empty, the user is working on stdin, so they will probably
// We don't want to spam the output with entire files with no matches in that case,
// that the user is probably searching for something, potentially in a group of files.
// if args has files it is working on, and the command list has a global, that means
// fmt_lines is empty, so the user didn't write any -c commands
// Let's figure out if we want to print the whole buffer
// Next we loop over `args.cmds` and execute each one in sequence.
// Here we are going to initialize a new instance of `ViCut` to manage state for editing this input
// Execute the user's commands.
// The loop looks for patterns like {{1}} or {{foo}} to interpolate on
// We use a state machine here to interpolate the fields
// Format the output according to the given format string
// Push the new string
// Also clear fields for the next line
// Join the fields by the delimiter
// So let's double pop the 2d vector and grab the value of our only field
// We performed len checks in no_fields_extracted(), so unwrap is safe
// Let's check to see if we are outputting the whole buffer
// If we did extract some fields, we print each record one at a time, and each field will be separated by `delimiter`
// If we didn't extract any fields, we do our best to preserve the formatting of the original input
// Perform standard output formatting.
// This can be depended on, since `"0"` is a reserved field name that cannot be set by user input.
// Checks for the `"0"` field name, which is a sentinel value that says "We didn't get any `-c` commands"
// Check to see if we didn't explicitly extract any fields
// Format the output as JSON
// `lines` is a two-dimensional vector of tuples, each representing a key/value pair for extract fields.
// Format the stuff we extracted according to user specification
// If `trace` is true, then trace!() calls always activate, with our custom formatting.
// This interacts with the `--trace` flag that can be passed in the arguments.
// Initialize the logger
// Prints out the help info for `vicut`

/// Checks to make sure the following invariants are met:

// no need to be pressed about a missing '--end' when nothing would come after it

// If we got here, we have run out of arguments
// We're done here

/// Handles `-g` and `-v` global conditionals.
// So we can't let people use it arbitrarily, or weird shit starts happening
